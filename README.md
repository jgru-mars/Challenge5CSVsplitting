# Challenge5SplitCSV# Challenge5CSVsplittingandChallenge6

My program retreives the data from 2015.csv and splits it into two different csv files: Teams.csv and Institutions.csv. The program will create these files if they are not there already. I have it drop the duplicates during this process. I also assign Institution ID's to each city or institution if they do not already possess one. Both are done because some cities institutions with the same name.

You run my program through PyCharm by clicking on the green arrow next to "if __name__ == '__main__': main()" or the "Shift+F10" command on the keyboard.
